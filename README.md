## How to run the project:
For running the ipynb file, using colab would be enough. If you do not want to upload the ipynb file on the colab for running the model, I've added the url for the files:

## Crop Selection Feature Analysis

This project analyzes soil measurements to identify the most important feature for predicting optimal crop types, helping farmers make data-driven decisions about crop selection.

## Project Overview
The project aims to assist farmers in crop selection by:
- Analyzing soil measurements (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, and pH levels)
- Using machine learning to identify the single most predictive feature for crop selection
- Building a multi-class classification model for crop prediction

## Dataset
The dataset (`soil_measures.csv`) contains:
- N: Nitrogen content ratio
- P: Phosphorous content ratio
- K: Potassium content ratio
- pH: pH value of the soil
- crop: Target variable indicating optimal crop type
